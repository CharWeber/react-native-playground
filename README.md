## by charles Weber


### this web app is a small exercise in react-native. First try getting it off the ground.

### requirements
  * react native
  * expo CLI
  * android emulation (I used android studio)
  
#### setup
* follow setup instructions for expo https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/expo-cli/
* follow install directions for android studio https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/
* open android emulator (looks like a fancy phone)
* create a new terminal instance in the project directory
* run this command ```npm run android``` if setup correctly your app should be running on your android emulator
